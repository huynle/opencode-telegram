description: Link this OpenCode session to a Telegram topic for remote monitoring
---

Use the `telegram_link` tool to connect this session to Telegram.

If the user provided a custom topic name in $ARGUMENTS, pass it as the `topicName` parameter.
Otherwise, let the tool use the default (directory name).

Call the tool now and report the result to the user.
